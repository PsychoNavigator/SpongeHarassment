Lol. Good one, that was really funny how you think you've banned me. 

LokiChaos, yes, MS can DMCA Sponge easily, as well as me because there is content that is similar to my code, and the license is GPL so you can't ues it in Sponge. 

I'm not going on Bukkit and ranting you guys out again, because too many people would stay away from Sponge! Continue harassing more members and you'll never have a doubt of sucess!

Evilmidgent, I know what multithreading is. Most of Trident's code is thread-confined, but I haven't caught everything yet, thanks.

Also, please stop swearing because I am 3 years old. I would  be glad to see you be banned from the channel, as it clearly states keep it PG! 

I'm not going to start on reddit because I'm gonna get banned again! What a great reaction to people against your project Sponge!

Disconsented, you have no idea how much I have to say. But I'm not going to say it because I'm really nice :D

[01:11:23] <Jesika> Losers.
[01:11:52] <@Disconsented> thats mean
[01:28:48] * LokiChaos giggles as a certain thread disappears from the Bukkit forums.
[01:29:47] * Jesika pokes LokiChaos
[01:29:49] <Jesika> Which
[01:30:15] <LokiChaos> xTrollxDudex's
[01:33:26] <LokiChaos> Because making a thread to whine about having a thread locked and being banned on another forum for trolling is such a good idea >_<
[01:33:44] <PierreC> Yeah I know
[01:36:52] <PierreC> thank you Sponge, for producing these wonderful Spongetards that need counseling because of the retardation from being on Sponge
[01:37:04] <@drtshock> please don't flame bait.
[01:37:17] <PierreC> Oh hey drt
[01:37:19] <@drtshock> or using derogatory terms such as you just did.
[01:37:23] <PierreC> I needed to talk to you for a while
[01:37:29] <@mbaxter> Oh hi trolldude-dude
[01:37:35] <PierreC> hello mbaxter
[01:37:38] <PierreC> how are you doing
[01:37:48] <@mbaxter> How's that Bukkit thread working out for ya
[01:37:53] <PierreC> Very nicely
[01:37:59] <PierreC> but I can't see the stats anymore
[01:38:34] <@mbaxter> Why waste your time trolling, when you could be trying to make that trident mod actually useful?
[01:39:35] <PierreC> Um, going through 78K lines and still not grateful eh?
[01:39:59] <@Disconsented> Greatful for what? All you have done is kick some dirt up
[01:40:08] <@Dark-Arcana> lol
[01:40:09] <PierreC> that's a good thing
[01:40:22] <@mbaxter> PierreC: You have yet to provide actual useful information. Go on...
[01:40:31] <PierreC> with?
[01:40:36] <@Dark-Arcana> PierreC: I have one question.
[01:40:45] <PierreC> I've said I'm done really helping Sponge
[01:40:45] <@Dark-Arcana> You referred to a moderator named "Guy". Who were you talking about?
[01:40:58] <PierreC> hi evil
[01:41:03] <PierreC> Guy is a moderator?
[01:41:03] <@mbaxter> < PierreC> I've said I'm done really helping Sponge
[01:41:07] <@mbaxter> When did you, uh, start.
[01:41:12] <@Dark-Arcana> lol mbaxter
[01:41:14] <PierreC> 3 days ago
[01:41:25] <@mbaxter> PierreC: Where?
[01:41:33] <PierreC> on your github repo
[01:41:41] <@Dark-Arcana> I asked you to present a competent and logical argument to make your case.
[01:41:42] <@mbaxter> Oh? Could you link me to it.
[01:41:42] <PierreC> did you notice your traffic increase
[01:41:44] <@Dark-Arcana> You didn't do that.
[01:41:49] <PierreC> oh
[01:41:50] <PierreC> ok
[01:41:51] <PierreC> yea
[01:41:52] <PierreC> of course
[01:41:54] <PierreC> let me find it
[01:41:57] <PierreC> cause its way to hard to find
[01:41:59] <evilmidget38> hey
[01:42:07] <PierreC> https://github.com/Spenge
[01:42:09] <@mbaxter> Yeah, I haven't found the github repo yet either. Don't worry.
[01:42:12] <PierreC> that should be the sponge
[01:42:14] <PierreC> repo
[01:42:22] <PierreC> Is 6 a high IQ?
[01:42:29] <@Dark-Arcana> riiiight
[01:42:31] <@Dark-Arcana> spenge
[01:42:35] <PierreC> yea
[01:42:40] <PierreC> is that what its called
[01:43:13] <@Dark-Arcana> So sk89q probably has it right. Someone marked your project down as too early in development on one of our first docs. You got super butthurt and have been trolling since.
[01:43:13] <PierreC> LokiChaos I'm looking at the logs and laughing so hard
[01:43:14] <@Dark-Arcana> RIght?
[01:43:28] <PierreC> lol no
[01:43:34] <PierreC> sk89q idc
[01:43:43] <PierreC> I'm done with him too
[01:43:58] <@Dark-Arcana> lol Disconsented no need.
[01:44:01] <@Dark-Arcana> I wanted to hear him out.
[01:44:03] <@Disconsented> I disagree
[01:44:06] <@Dark-Arcana> See where he was going.
[01:44:11] <evilmidget38> Dark-Arcana: His project is a highly sophisticated multithreaded minecraft server being made by a group of developers with no understanding of multithreading.
[01:44:20] <@Disconsented> He has no intention of doing aything constructive
[01:44:21] <@Dark-Arcana> hehehe
[01:44:38] <@Dark-Arcana> Well that solves that.
[01:44:42] <@sk89q> did you just ban everyone from comcast via web chat
[01:44:44] <@Dark-Arcana> Anyway, let him bitch on bukkit forums.
[01:44:47] <@Dark-Arcana> Let it be curse's problem.
[01:44:51] <@Disconsented> Yep
[01:44:52] <@Dark-Arcana> @Kaelten
[01:44:53] <@Dark-Arcana> lol
[01:45:11] <LokiChaos> As a somewhat serious reponse:  Wouldn't the similarities you claim between Forge/Sponge and mc-dev be intrisically required as that is how one interfaces with the Minecraft server?  NB: I've not looked at any of the code in question, just my understanding of what Forge/MCP does and mc-dev simply being a automated dump of the same code it's interfacing with.
[01:45:22] <LokiChaos> Oh, he's gone.  Oh well :)
[01:45:25] <eyamaz> No Dark-Arcana I removed the post
[01:45:36] <@Dark-Arcana> haha eyamaz nice.
[01:45:48] <@Disconsented> Okay that should let comcasters still connect
[01:46:21] <LokiChaos> How many people actually register a nick and /still/ use webchat?
[01:47:21] <@drtshock> people that come here just to troll
[01:47:44] <@Disconsented> Ban Quota achieved
[01:48:51] <kodfod> You shooting for extra credit?
[01:49:15] <@Disconsented> I normally undershoot my quota :)
[01:49:36] <kodfod> :P
[01:54:38] <@mbaxter> <@Disconsented> He has no intention of doing aything constructive
[01:54:51] <@mbaxter> Sure, but that doesn't mean he isn't entertaining to poke :3
[01:54:57] <@Disconsented> ik
[01:55:18] <@Disconsented> But I changed my mind and I agree with what drt said in the staff channel
