Looks like they found out. Amazing how fast news spreads.

According to the interpretation by eyemaz, which is, yes, the admin associated with Sponge that
deleted my thread that was too hard for you to handle. So anyways, just ask him, because he knows
how you are harrassing me ;)

Ok so, why would you ban me, for doing absolutely nothing. Then, after that, you start spreading
misinformation that no one really cares about just so that others can be on your side. 

I don't want attention. I just want to make sure that no more people will just support Sponge
without thinking about how bad the situation really is. Development is fast going off track and
more and more useless commits to show how active development is are starting to be figured out.
The community is moderated by a bunch of people who don't really know what they are doing and ban
for fun, thinking that it is really easy to go through 9,700 lines of code 8 times. 

Thank you mbaxter for starring this repository. Please watch and fork because no one really knows how
far downhill Sponge is.

Loki, I am reconsidering my DMCA idea. I don't want to DMCA a repositiory full of inefficient code
that looks like it was copied from my projects. I don't want to be the guy that says, "hey, I wrote
that inefficient code that Sponge copied off of," so there you have it.

You guys have a right to be mindful of what you say even when I am not there to see it.

Phroa, I don't care. I don't want to format your useless chatter insulting me behind closed doors.

And yes disconsented, please leave it. Leave Sponge. Leave your idiotic crusade. Leave behind 
whatever Sponge has taught you. And thank you for not swearing this time.

[02:50:24] <@mbaxter> Jesika: ok
[02:54:12] <LokiChaos> I'd love to see the portions similar enough to his code, but not the MC server's, to make him feel he has a copyright standing.
[02:54:33] <@phroa> ...maybe we just shouldn't talk about this
[02:55:03] <@Disconsented> Yep subject chaning time
